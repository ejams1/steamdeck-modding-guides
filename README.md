A source for guides to get up and running with modding games on the Steam Deck.

## Why No Mod Organizer 2?

From my experience, Mod Organizer 2 makes for an unpleasant experience on the Steam Deck as it:

- Added 2-4 _minutes_ to the launch time for any game I tried
- Is sluggish to navigate
- Caused unneeded complexity due to needing to reconfigure the paths for everything since the installation was copied from a different computer

Therefore, my guides have been prepared such that we will configure everything on a Windows machine and skip the need for MO2 so that our games launch as fast as possible.
