# Bethesda Game Guides

Bethesda games from Oblivion and onward can be modded in very similar ways, so most of the guides in this section will be written in a way that can be applied to any game in that range.

## Why No Mod Organizer 2?

From my experience, Mod Organizer 2 makes for an unpleasant experience on the Steam Deck as it:

- Added 2-4 _minutes_ to the launch time for any game I tried
- Is sluggish to navigate
- Caused unneeded complexity due to needing to reconfigure the paths for everything since the installation was copied from a different computer

Therefore, my guides have been prepared such that we will configure everything on a Windows machine and skip the need for MO2 so that our games launch as fast as possible.

## List of Known-Incompatible Mods With the Steam Deck

For some reason, there are certain mods that just don't function correctly on the Steam Deck and can cause crashing, freezing, or other undesired behaviour. Ensure that you do not include these mods in your lists, and if they are included in a premade list from Wabbajack, make sure you remove/disable them.

## Wabbajack Guides

The easiest way to get a modded game up and running is by using a premade list through Wabbajack. Wabbajack is a tool that allows for automating modlist installations so that the end user doesn't have to deal with conflicts, load order, visual settings, etc.

Wabbajack does not have a Linux app, so these guides will be written such that the list will be set up and configured on a Windows machine and then transferred over to the deck.

There are a few different ways that authors build their lists, which matters to us when we try to install the lists on the Steam Deck.
